# Neural Network
This is the baseline to my senior project. It is a multi-perceptron neural network that can learn based on the data that is fed through the algorithm. Using backpropigation, the algorithm tweaks different values, and normallizes the dataset with a sigmodial activation function. My plan is to implement this neural network inside of a drone to develop an accident avoidance system that is automomous.
